# Security and Compliance Enhancement for SAGE Books

## Objective
This project aims to enhance the security framework and compliance standards of SAGE Books, focusing on addressing identified gaps in the company's security measures. The improvements will ensure compliance with industry standards such as PCI DSS and GDPR while mitigating risks related to physical and logical vulnerabilities.

## Skills Learned
- Risk Assessment and Management
- Regulatory Compliance (PCI DSS, GDPR)
- Incident Response Planning
- Business Continuity Planning
- Cybersecurity Awareness Training Development

## Tools Used
- NIST SP 800-61 R2 (Incident Response Guide)
- ISO/IEC 27002 (Information Security Standard)
- GDPR Compliance Tools

## Steps

### 1. **Identify Security Gaps**
   - **Security Best Practices Alignment:** The security program was found lacking alignment with industry standards, especially concerning asset protection, payment card information, and customer privacy compliance in the EU.
   - **Policies and Procedures:** Deficiencies in implementing PCI DSS and GDPR-compliant procedures, including gaps in mobile device regulations, password security, and safeguarding PII.
   - **PCI DSS & GDPR Compliance:** Lack of documented protocols for handling payment card data and securing EU citizens' data.
   - **Security Team Expertise:** Inadequate cybersecurity training and awareness programs.
   - **Incident Response & Business Continuity Planning:** Insufficient incident response plans and inadequate consideration of disaster scenarios in BCP.

### 2. **Develop Mitigation Strategies**
   - **Policy Development:** Creation and regular review of comprehensive security policies aligned with PCI DSS and GDPR.
   - **Enhanced PCI DSS Compliance:** Implement encryption and access controls for cardholder data.
   - **GDPR Compliance Measures:** Appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) and update privacy policies.
   - **Strengthening the Security Team:** Hire experts in GRC and continuously train staff in cybersecurity.
   - **Improved Incident Response Plan:** Update the IRP to follow NIST SP 800-61 R2 and conduct regular drills.
   - **Business Continuity Planning:** Develop disaster-specific BCPs and conduct routine testing.

### 3. **Establish Critical Security Roles**
   - **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) Manager:**
     - Develop and supervise the GRC strategy.
     - Ensure compliance with PCI DSS, GDPR, and other regulations.
     - Conduct regular risk audits and update senior management.
   - **Data Protection Officer (DPO):**
     - Monitor GDPR compliance and conduct DPIAs.
     - Serve as a contact point for data processing matters.
   - **Incident Response Manager:**
     - Develop and oversee the IRP.
     - Lead the incident response team and conduct post-breach analyses.

### 4. **Address Physical and Logical Vulnerabilities**
   - **Physical Threats:**
     - Distribution centers in high-risk areas for natural disasters (earthquakes, tornadoes).
     - Inadequate security measures in retail locations prone to theft and vandalism.
     - Lack of protocols to protect organizational assets.
   - **Logical Threats:**
     - Non-adherence to PCI DSS in handling payment card information.
     - Absence of GDPR compliance measures for EU citizens' data.
     - Weak cybersecurity awareness programs leading to human error risks.

### 5. **Develop Cybersecurity Awareness Training Program**
   - **Annual Training Requirements:** Cover basic cybersecurity concepts, company policies, and phishing recognition.
   - **Specialized Training:** Target IT personnel and management with advanced training on threat identification and secure coding.
   - **Continuous Awareness:** Conduct regular updates, phishing simulations, and workshops.

### 6. **Formulate an Incident Response Plan (IRP)**
   - **Preparation:** Assemble a cross-functional incident response team and establish policies based on NIST SP 800-61.
   - **Detection and Analysis:** Use security tools to continuously monitor and identify incidents.
   - **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery:** Implement short-term containment strategies, eradicate threats, and recover affected systems.
   - **Post-Incident Activity:** Document and analyze the incident, review the response, and communicate lessons learned.

### 7. **Develop a Business Continuity Plan (BCP)**
   - **Project Scope and Planning:** Address natural disasters and create a comprehensive continuity plan.
   - **Business Impact Analysis:** Identify critical functions and assess potential impacts of disruptions.
   - **Continuity Planning:** Develop risk mitigation strategies, backup systems, and emergency response procedures.
   - **Plan Approval and Implementation:** Obtain management approval, conduct training, and regularly test the BCP.
